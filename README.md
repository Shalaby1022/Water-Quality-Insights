## Overview
This repository contains a spectacular data mining project focused on water quality analysis. The project involves advanced data cleaning, imputation, outlier handling, feature scaling, and the implementation of powerful machine learning models to predict water potability.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from "water_potability.csv" and covers various water quality parameters.

## Project Structure
- **Data Cleaning and Exploration:**
  - Handling missing values
  - Outlier detection and removal
  - Data visualization with histograms and correlation heatmaps

- **Data Preparation:**
  - Imputing missing values using the mean
  - Outlier replacement using the IQR method
  - Min-Max scaling

- **Model Implementation:**
  - [Decision Tree Classifier](#decision-tree-classifier)
  - [K-Nearest Neighbors](#k-nearest-neighbors)
  - [Random Forest](#random-forest)
  - [Logistic Regression](#logistic-regression)
  - [XGBoost Classifier](#xgboost-classifier)
  - [Bagging Classifier](#bagging-classifier)

- **Model Evaluation:**
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score
  - Confusion matrices and visualizations

- **Model Optimization:**
  - Cross-validation for Decision Tree
  - Bagging Classifier with out-of-bag scoring
